# Medical Telegram Bot: Using OpenAI models & SDKs with no daily limits.

We all love [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com), but... It's TERRIBLY laggy, has daily limits, and is only accessible through an archaic web interface.

This repo is MedicalGPT re-created as Telegram Bot. **And it works great.**

## Features
- Low latency replies (it usually takes about 3-5 seconds)
- No request limits
- Message streaming
- Support of [ChatGPT API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/chat/introduction)
- List of allowed Telegram users
- This bot has been created under the guidance of a certified Dr.
- This bot understands when certain sentences indicates certain diseases or concerns, and then it asks follow up questions accordingly.
- It also prescribes users based on thier medical conditions, medications, surgeries, allergies etc. which it asks for during registeration process.
- This also allows you to integrate your cal.com account, which allows you to book appointments for specialized treatment from Dr.
